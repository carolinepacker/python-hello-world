# Overview

This is my first GitHub repository! It is a learning experience for me 
publishing code into public repositories!

This piece of software is a simple first Hello World program! It asks for a user's name, then prints "Hello (name) and Hello World!".

The purpose of this program is for me to learn how to publish code from Visual Studio Code to my GitHub Repository.

I used Visual Studio Code, the Python extension for VS Code, and Git.

I used the Python language for this program.
